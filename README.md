# Youtube Video Thumbnail Extractor C#
Extracts Youtube Video Thumbnail By Providing URL. Extracted Thumbnail can be used for several other purposes.

The project is created in Windows c# forms. The purpose of this tool is to extract thumbnails of videos. The extracted thumbnail can be used for several marketing and distribution reasons. I extract thumbnails to make better visualization in Photoshop or cut out some required image this might not be available on google image search results. This project can be used for research purposes like finding videos on the basis of thumbnails that contain particular text or object using OCR,NLP along with machine learning and Artificial Intelligence Techniques.
